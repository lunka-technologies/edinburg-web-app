# Aminl Platform

Tool that allows you to predict the success of attacking the disease with entered molecule.

App provides 2 approaches for molecular input:

- draw desired molecule with embedded Chemaxon Marvin JS editor
- enter molecule manually in SMILES format

Prediction is calculated by Python-based BE (Fast API / ngrok) and contains the senolytics chart with dataset generated by ML model.

Notable tools and libraries used in project:

- [Marvin JS](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/marvin-js.md) is embedded as molecule editor
- [RDkit](https://www.rdkitjs.com/) used to validate molecules in SMILES format and to render the molecular structure
- [@mui/material](https://mui.com/material-ui/) is React component library that is used as general styling approach
- [@nivo/scatterplot](https://nivo.rocks/scatterplot/) used to visualise ML dataset as a chart
